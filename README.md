# Sound-Transmission-using-LASER
● Developed an electronic circuit that uses light as a faster medium to transmit sound signals ● Input sound is converted and fed to a LASER at the transmission end and captured as light on a solar panel at the receiver end which is then provided to a speaker output ● Achieved a clear and long ranged output with wire-free transmission process at the speed of light
